# odin-library
This was a pretty straightforward project on paper, but it took me a while to think of the implementation.

## What I learnt
- Using objects (instead of 2D lists)
- event.preventDefault() to avoid the form redirecting to another page
- Recursion (somehow made it work)
- You can style elements that don't formally exist in CSS (e.g. flex properties for an element with display:none)

## Challenges
- Figuring out how to structure the solution
- Using classes (new to me)
